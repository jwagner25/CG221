    <p> This is a website for the Suffolk County Gov page. I hate this website! It is suppose to be user friendly because it is a county/government site, but it isn't easy to use at all. One example I have, is when I was trying to book a campsite over the summer. This site is suppose to be able to bring you to the page to reserve a spot, but it doesn't. It has a page that tells you about the parks and campground and what they have to offer, but not the link to reserve a spot. The link isn't even on this site. They might have changed it since last summer, but I doubt they did. This site gets me very annoyed whenever I need to use it.  </p>

    <p> This is one of two sites that you can use to make a reservation for camping, particularly, Indian Island Campgrounds. This is one way to make a reservation and the other site I can not even find because you have to type in a certain wording to get the site on Google. I love this campground, but I hate registering for it. This is a nice and easy, straight forward site to use (once you find it). It has dates of when you can camp, prices, a site map, and 90% of the information you might want to know before going. This site would be perfect, if they had a link in the Suffolk County page, and if it was easy to type into Google to find. </p>
