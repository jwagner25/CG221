    <p> James R. Eads is an artist from california.He draws on a tablet and makes some of his illustrations into gifs by himself or with the help of TheGlich. TheGlich helps with making the image move like an optical illustion. James has done covers for the New York Times and concert poster for bands like Foo Fighters and Dave Matthew's Band. His art reminds me of a Vagho esk type of drawings. Most of his art is digital but he also paints as well. </p>
