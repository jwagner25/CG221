    <h2> My Favorite Internet 7 </h2>
    <h3><a href="http://andkon.com/arcade/">Andkon</a></h3>
    <p> Andkon is a gaming website I used to play when i was a kid. I would play games such as Paxon, which is a pacman type game, and Hex Empire, which is like Risk. I would play other games too, but those are the two I would play the most. This webiste has a bunch of games for kids of all ages, some weirder then others (like the kissing game). The one downside that i find with this site is that the way the games are layed out, is very random, and not easy to find. The way to choice/see the games is by little icons with imageson them. There is a search bar, but if you dont know the name of the game, you wont be able to search it.  </p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.miniclip.com/games/en/">MiniClip</a></h4>
    <p> Like Andkon, MiniClip is another gaming website. Me and my brother would have tordiments on this site with a pool game or a gun game. This site is easier to see the games names on t and is layed out under catigories, like puzzle games, multiplayer games, or action games. I think this webiste is more aimed toawrds younger kids from ages 6-13, while Andkon is more for kids 10 and up. I like both site, but this one does come in second when it comes to the game selecetion Miniclip has. </p>
