    <p> Dina Brodsky is a local artist currently living in Long Island City. She is a painter that paints miniatures. She also sketches and does a lot of tree drawings and bride drawings. Some of her favorite spots to sketch are the highline and a cafe by 29th street ad 10th ave. She is one of my favorite artist that my girlfriend told me about. I have a tree print of hers that I love! </p>

    <p> Matt Rota is an artist from Brooklyn. He paints in water color. He has a lot of really beautiful but also simple pieces like the one above called: "Terror In Little Saigon". He has a a few pieces in the Society Of Illustartors editorial show that was up in the last show they had. He has dozens of pieces which are on his site. His art is very opposite from Dina's, but both still very unique and pretty. </p>
