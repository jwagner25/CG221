    <h3><a href="https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com">This Is Why I'm Broke</a></h3>
    <p> This is why im broke is a cool webite for cool random stuff that normal people wouldnt thinkof buying or looking up. This site has things from duck bouncy houses to a batmobile. It crazy! There are also concpets on the site that youu can look at and i think vote or donate to/for. It a good site for buying a gag gift, gift for a geek, or a mom. It has almost everything, and its crazy the things you could find.  </p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a></h4>
    <p> Kickstarter is a sit that lets people raise money to make a product. When you donate, you could win prizes depending on how much you donate. This site is cool and helps people start samll businesses. Some of the stuff on the site can be found in stores or even Thisiswhyimbroke.com. I have used and gotten a few things from this site like a magnetic sketchbook, and a wooden watch. It's a cool and easy way to try and start something you are passionate about.</p>
