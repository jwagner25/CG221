    <p> Am I Collective is an art site based out of South Africa. The site is for graphic artist, illustrators and animators. The site holds tons of animations, illustrations, gifs, typography, pop type art, etc. This site is well set up, very graphic and cool/fun to explore. I found this site on accident and I’m glad I did. They have offices in NYC, London, Madrid, and Shanghai. This site is beautifully designed and maintained. The site is only for the viewing of artwork, not the purchasing of it. It’s like a giant collective portfolio website. I think this site is better then deviant art because it is just for view, and has a vast library of beautiful work that comes from all over the world by known, and talented artist. </p>

    <p> Deviant Art is a site that you can join and share your artwork. The site is very well known and I would recommend it to young artist or people that are just getting in to art.  Wouldn’t recommend it to a known working artist. The site has a mobile app, as well as a PC site. On the website you can buy, upload, share and browse art from all over the world. People that can and cant draw can upload and become a member of the site. In my experience with Deviant art, I have had problems and couldn’t find ‘good’ work for inspiration. That was a few years ago, now it looks more organized and has a better layout and better maintained. I said before that I wouldn’t recommend this site to professional artist, because I feel like it is better for people who are just getting into art and need ideas. I also feel like it’s a little childish, but as I said it has changed and I haven’t been a member on it in years. </p>
