      <h1>What is Wood1a?</h1>
      <p>
        Wood1a is a company that builds houses with sustainable, low cost, and beautiful. Wood1a makes high rises that are cheap and eco friendly. They are cut in the mill, shipped flat, delivered on time, never over budget, and assembled on site. The buildings can be one story or 40 stories high and can be 200 square feet or 200,000 square feet. This technology took about 20 years to developed and was created by German and Austrian engineers.

        This wood product is just as strong and durable as steel or concert structure, but unlike steel and concert wood takes in CO2. So theses buildings are taking in CO2 from the air around it. Some countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Canada, and more have these wood structures already. Within the next 2-3 years, Wood1a would like to build in 10 more countries. The wood is cross-laminated timber thats i cut in a mill and goes together like building blocks and screws. These new high rises are amazing, eco-friendly, and beautiful. Wood1a is giving the earth a chance by cutting back on CO2 so the earth can live a little longer and healthier.
