    <h3><a href="https://ifunny.co">iFunny</a></h3>
    <p> iFunny is an app for pictures and memes. When i first got it it was a bunch of cool, weird, crazy, trippy pictures that you can save and download, but today it is mostly memes. This site is also an app that is easy to use and updates every few hours with new material. You can search certain types of pictures you want to see, but itsnt the best at deplaying catigories of pictures. The app and webiste are easy to use and it is a fun way to pass the time.  </p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a></h4>
    <p> Reddit is a webiste and app that deplays picture and you can comment on them like a thread or blog in a way.T This is like iFunny, but is more of a blog type meme website. This site has almost everything form unicorns to R rated things. There are catigories or subreddits that you can look into. I find the app to be hard to use and the website to be eaiser. Personally i dont like the site at all, but i have used it to tr it out. </p>
