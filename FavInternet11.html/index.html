    <p> Apple is a company that sells iProducts to the world. Apples website is very sleek and professonal looking. With easy tabs to search and ask about things. Easy to use, user friendly too. It is a clean, sleek look to a website, almost futuristic! Over all good site and very helpful as well. </p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.android.com/">Andriod</a></h4>
    <p> Andriod is another phone company thats sells different type of cell phone. These are more like the older versions, but nicer and more user friendly. Their webpage is very happy, and placeful because of the slight colors and easy to see font. Like happy it has easy tabs to use. Unlike this site is less professional and morte playful, which is also kind of nice to approch, especially if you didnt know the company.     </p>
