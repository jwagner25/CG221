    <h2> My Favorite Internet 10 </h2>
    <h3><a href="https://8tracks.com">8Tracks</a></h3>
    <p> 8Tracks is an amazing webste/app for music. This site lets you make playlists that others can like and listen to. Its a great way to find new music and have playlists that are undercertain catigories. you can choice the type of music or artist you want to listen to and itll bring up playlists that fall into the catigory that you searched. Since about 4 months ago 8Tracks now requires you to pay for its services, and you only get on hour of free music. This was my favorite music streaming site, but now you have to pay which isnt fun. </p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a></h4>
    <p> Pandora is one of the oldest internet streaming sites. You can pick stations and it gives random songs unlike 8Tracks which will give you a more direct choice of music. Pandora also has a thing called Pandora1 which you pay for and get ad free music. Pandora is nice, but 8Tracks is tsill my favorite.    </p>
